# Workout Tracker

Workout Tracker is a Django application that allows users to create and track their workouts. It is developed using Django, Bootstrap4, and PostgreSQL. The application consists of several modules, including signup, sign-in, sign-out, workout list, workout detail, new workout, and routine.

## Features

### Sign up

Users who don't have an account can create a new account by signing up. The signup form includes fields for username, password, and confirm password. If a username is already taken, an alert message is displayed.

### Sign out

Users can use this feature to log out from the application.

### Workout list

This screen displays all the workouts of the user. Clicking on a particular workout takes the user to a page with detailed information about that workout.

### Workout details

This screen provides information about the workout, such as exercises, reps, weights for each exercise, and the duration of the training. Users can edit or delete the workout.

### New workout

Users can create a new workout themselves or upload saved workout routines from themselves or other users. They can make changes to the workout and save it as a routine if they want to repeat the workout or share it with others.

### Workout screen

This screen allows users to enter the reps for each set of exercises.
